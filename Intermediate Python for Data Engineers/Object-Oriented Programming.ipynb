    "# Object-Oriented Programming\n",
    "## Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming\n",
    "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses \"objects\" to design applications and computer programs. It utilizes several techniques from previously established paradigms, including modularity, polymorphism, and encapsulation. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior. The object's attributes are defined by its properties, while its behavior is defined by its methods. The object's properties and methods are defined by its class. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Dog:\n",
    "  sound = \"Woof\"\n",
    "\n",
    "  def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "    self.name = name\n",
    "    self.age = age\n",
    "\n",
    "  def bark(self):\n",
    "    print(Dog.sound)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties and methods that all objects of that class will have. In OOP, objects are created from classes, and these objects interact with each other to perform tasks. OOP is widely used in software development because it provides a way to model real-world entities and relationships in a program. It also helps to organize code, improve code reusability, and make code easier to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, we have defined a class `Dog` that represents a dog. The class has two properties, `name` and `age`, and one method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Four Core Pillars of OOP:\n",
    "- **Encapsulation**: Encapsulation is the process of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit called a class. It restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which prevents the accidental modification of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Abstraction**: Abstraction is the process of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object. It helps to reduce programming complexity and effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inheritance**: Inheritance is a mechanism in which one class acquires the properties and behavior of another class. It promotes code reusability and allows the creation of a new class that is based on an existing class.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Polymorphism**: Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on multiple forms. It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. Polymorphism is achieved through method overriding and method overloading.\n",
    "\n",
    "## OOP Pillar: Inheritance\n",
    "### Syntax:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class ParentClass:\n",
    "  #class methods/properties...\n",
    "\n",
    "class ChildClass(ParentClass):\n",
    "  #class methods/properties...\n",
    "```\n",
    "Instead of writing a code like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Dog:\n",
    "  def bark(self):\n",
    "    print('Woof!')\n",
    "\n",
    "class Cat:\n",
    "  def meow(self):\n",
    "    print('Meow!')\n",
    "```\n",
    "We can use inheritance to avoid code duplication:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "  def speak(self):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        print('Woof!')\n",
    "\n",
    "class Cat(Animal):\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        print('Meow!')\n",
    "```\n",
    "This allows them to share common attributes and methods defined in the `Animal` class. Inheritance promotes code reusability and helps to create a hierarchy of classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overriding Methods\n",
    "It is a common practice to override methods in the child class to provide a specific implementation. When a method in the child class has the same name as a method in the parent class, the child class method overrides the parent class method.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "  def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "    self.name = name\n",
    "\n",
    "  def make_noise(self):\n",
    "    print(\"{} says, Grrrr\".format(self.name))\n",
    "\n",
    "pet1 = Animal(\"Rex\")\n",
    "pet1.make_noise() # Rex says, Grrrr\n",
    "```\n",
    "Since the Animal class has a generic `make_noise` method, we can override it in the child class:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Cat(Animal):\n",
    "  def make_noise(self):\n",
    "    print(\"{} says, Meow!\".format(self.name))\n",
    "\n",
    "pet2 = Cat(\"Maisy\")\n",
    "pet2.make_noise() # Maisy says, Meow!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## super()\n",
    "The `super()` function is used to call the parent class's methods from the child class. It returns a temporary object of the superclass that allows you to call its methods. This is useful when you want to extend the functionality of the parent class method in the child class.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "  def __init__(self, name, sound=\"Grrrr\"):\n",
    "    self.name = name\n",
    "    self.sound = sound\n",
    "\n",
    "  def make_noise(self):\n",
    "    print(\"{} says, {}\".format(self.name, self.sound))\n",
    "\n",
    "class Cat(Animal):\n",
    "  def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "    super().__init__(name, \"Meow!\") \n",
    "\n",
    "pet_cat = Cat(\"Rachel\")\n",
    "pet_cat.make_noise() # Rachel says, Meow!\n",
    "```\n",
    "## Multiple Inheritance: Part 1\n",
    "Multiple inheritance is a feature of some object-oriented programming languages in which a class can inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class. This allows a child class to inherit from multiple parent classes, which can be useful in certain situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "  def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "    self.name = name\n",
    " \n",
    "  def say_hi(self):\n",
    "    print(\"{} says, Hi!\".format(self.name))\n",
    "\n",
    "class Cat(Animal):\n",
    "  pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class Angry_Cat(Cat):\n",
    "  pass\n",
    "\n",
    "my_pet = Angry_Cat(\"Mr. Cranky\")\n",
    "my_pet.say_hi() # Mr. Cranky says, Hi!\n",
    "```\n",
    "In the above example, the `Angry_Cat` class inherits from both the `Cat` and `Animal` classes. This allows the `Angry_Cat` class to access the `say_hi` method defined in the `Animal` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multiple Inheritance: Part 2\n",
    "In Python, when a class inherits from multiple parent classes, it follows the order specified in the class definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "  def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "    self.name = name\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "  def action(self):\n",
    "    print(\"{} wags tail. Awwww\".format(self.name))\n",
    "\n",
    "class Wolf(Animal):\n",
    "  def action(self):\n",
    "    print(\"{} bites. OUCH!\".format(self.name))\n",
    "\n",
    "class Hybrid(Dog, Wolf):\n",
    "  def action(self):\n",
    "    super().action()\n",
    "    Wolf.action(self)\n",
    "\n",
    "my_pet = Hybrid(\"Fluffy\")\n",
    "my_pet.action() # Fluffy wags tail. Awwww\n",
    "                # Fluffy bites. OUCH!\n",
    "```\n",
    "In the above example, the `Hybrid` class inherits from both the `Dog` and `Wolf` classes. The `super().action()` call in the `Hybrid` class calls the `action` method of the `Dog` class, while the `Wolf.action(self)` call explicitly calls the `action` method of the `Wolf` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "## OOP Pillar: Polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on multiple forms. In Python, polymorphism is achieved through method overriding and method overloading.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "  def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "    self.name = name\n",
    "\n",
    "  def make_noise(self):\n",
    "    print(\"{} says, Grrrr\".format(self.name))\n",
    "\n",
    "class Cat(Animal):\n",
    "  def make_noise(self):\n",
    "    print(\"{} says, Meow!\".format(self.name))\n",
    "\n",
    "class Robot:\n",
    "  def make_noise(self):\n",
    "    print(\"beep.boop...BEEEEP!!!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "an_animal = Animal(\"Bear\")\n",
    "my_pet = Cat(\"Maisy\")\n",
    "my_vacuum = Robot()\n",
    "objects = [an_animal, my_pet, my_vacuum]\n",
    "for o in objects:\n",
    "  o.make_noise()\n",
    "\n",
    "# OUTPUT\n",
    "# \"Bear says, Grrrr\"\n",
    "# \"Maisy says, Meow!\"\n",
    "# \"beep.boop...BEEEEP!!!\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "In the above example, the `Animal`, `Cat`, and `Robot` classes all have a `make_noise` method. When we call the `make_noise` method on each object, the specific implementation of the method is executed based on the object's class. This is an example of polymorphism in action.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dunder Methods\n",
    "The name dunder methods comes from the double underscores that are used in the method names. These methods are also known as magic methods or special methods. They are used to define the behavior of objects in Python. Dunder methods are called implicitly by Python when certain operations are performed on objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "  def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "    self.name = name\n",
    "\n",
    "  def __repr__(self):\n",
    "    return self.name\n",
    "\n",
    "  def __add__(self, another_animal):\n",
    "    return Animal(self.name + another_animal.name)\n",
    "\n",
    "a1 = Animal(\"Horse\")\n",
    "a2 = Animal(\"Penguin\")\n",
    "a3 = a1 + a2\n",
    "print(a1) # Prints \"Horse\"\n",
    "print(a2) # Prints \"Penguin\"\n",
    "print(a3) # Prints \"HorsePenguin\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "In the above example, we have defined the `__repr__` and `__add__` dunder methods for the `Animal` class. The `__repr__` method returns a string representation of the object, and the `__add__` method defines the behavior of the `+` operator when used with `Animal` objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## OOP Pillar: Abstraction\n",
    "Abstraction is the process of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object. It helps to reduce programming complexity and effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
    "\n",
    "class Animal(ABC):\n",
    "  def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "    self.name = name\n",
    "\n",
    "  @abstractmethod\n",
    "  def make_noise(self):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class Cat(Animal):\n",
    "  def make_noise(self):\n",
    "    print(\"{} says, Meow!\".format(self.name))\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "  def make_noise(self):\n",
    "    print(\"{} says, Woof!\".format(self.name))\n",
    "\n",
    "kitty = Cat(\"Maisy\")\n",
    "doggy = Dog(\"Amber\")\n",
    "kitty.make_noise() # \"Maisy says, Meow!\"\n",
    "doggy.make_noise() # \"Amber says, Woof!\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, the `Animal` class is an abstract class that defines an abstract method `make_noise`. The `Cat` and `Dog` classes inherit from the `Animal` class and provide concrete implementations of the `make_noise` method. The `@abstractmethod` decorator is used to mark the `make_noise` method as abstract, which means that any class that inherits from `Animal` **must implement** this method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The below line of code would raise an error:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "an_animal = Animal(\"Scruffy\")\n",
    "# TypeError: Can't instantiate abstract class Animal with abstract method make_noise\n",
    "```\n",
    "## OOP Pillar: Encapsulation\n",
    "Encapsulation is the process of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit called a class. It restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which prevents the accidental modification of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In python it doesn't have a strict way to enforce encapsulation, but in practice, we can use the following conventions:\n",
    "\n",
    "`_` (single underscore): This is prefixed to a variable to indicate that it is **protected**. A protected variable should not be accessed directly from outside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "`__` (double underscore): This is prefixed to a variable to indicate that it is **private**. A private variable should only be accessed within the class that defines it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** It is different from dunger methods, which has leading and trailing double underscores.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getters, Setters and Deleters\n",
    "Using this functions are a way to enforce encapsulation in Python. They allow you to control access to the attributes of a class and provide a way to validate the data before setting or getting it.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "  def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "    self._name = name\n",
    "    self._age = None\n",
    "\n",
    "  def get_age(self):\n",
    "    return self._age\n",
    "\n",
    "  def set_age(self, new_age):\n",
    "    if isinstance(new_age, int):\n",
    "      self._age = new_age\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "      raise TypeError\n",
    "\n",
    "  def delete_age(self):\n",
    "    print(\"_age Deleted\")\n",
    "    del self._age\n",
    "\n",
    "a = Animal(\"Rufus\")\n",
    "print(a.get_age()) # None\n",
    "\n",
    "a.set_age(10)\n",
    "print(a.get_age()) # 10\n",
    "\n",
    "a.set_age(\"Ten\") # Raises a TypeError\n",
    "\n",
    "a.delete_age() # \"_age Deleted\"\n",
    "print(a.get_age()) # Raises a AttributeError\n",
    "```\n",
    "The `del` keyword is used to delete an attribute from an object. In the above example, the `delete_age` method deletes the `_age` attribute from the `Animal` object."
